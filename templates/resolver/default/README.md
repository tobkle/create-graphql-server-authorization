In order to enable different authorization concepts,
the templates with a specific and opinionated authorization concept
are factored out, in a own npm module. You will find those templates
in the following npm module:

** node_modules/create-graphql-server-authorization/templates/auth **

Please feel free to fork create-graphql-server-authorization
and implement your own authorization concept there, or add your own
templates here.
